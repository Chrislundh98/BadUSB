## Description
This is a harmless script designed to mess with your friends using keystroke injection to install and decode a Python script that randomly opens a message box and plays the default Windows notification sound on random locations on the screen with a playful message, the script will hold off on executing the payload until it senses mouse movement, so you can install the payload and wait for your friend to return to their computer and enjoy the show.

To turn it off, press and hold left ctrl + right ctrl for 5 seconds
