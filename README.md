# Developed by Chris 

# For educational use and purpose only

# I am not responsible for any malicious action used by the scripts or files in this repository

# Usage: 
##   this is a duckyscript that utilizes the github repo together with discord webhooks to download and decode a keylogger, it works with FlipperZero

## NOT PLUG AND PLAY !
## ToDo:
###   Make sure to replace the webhook in keylogger.py with your own and upload it to your own repo
###   Make sure to replace the encoded text file with your own updated Base64 encoded keylogger.exe after compiling it
###   Make sure to update the github link to your own aswell as the encoded text file in the duckyscript
###   When all changes are done, open qFlipper and move the keylog_encoded.txt into your badUSB folder on your flipper

# happy hacking :)
