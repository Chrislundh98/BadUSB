## About the Developer

Hello! My name is Chris, and I am currently pursuing my studies in cybersecurity at the Jönköping School of Engineering. My journey into the realm of cybersecurity is driven by a passion for understanding the intricacies of digital security, malware, and the mechanisms behind their operation and mitigation.

## Project Overview

This repository serves as a digital sandbox for my academic exploration into the world of malware, specifically focusing on the development and deployment strategies used in real-world scenarios. The scripts and methodologies discussed and developed here are designed to work with hardware like FlipperZero and BadUSB devices, among similar tools, providing a hands-on approach to learning cybersecurity.

### Educational Objective

The primary goal of this project is to foster a deep understanding of how malware is designed, deployed, and how its presence can be detected and countered. By experimenting with BadUSB scripts and analyzing their impact on digital environments, I aim to gain insights into:

- The technical composition and operational logic of malware.
- Various deployment strategies and their real-world applications.
- Techniques employed by cybersecurity professionals to detect and neutralize threats.
