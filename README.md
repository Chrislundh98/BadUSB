# Description
  ## This is a repo designed for FlipperZero/BadUSB
  ## This is not plug-and-play
  ## This repo utilizes DuckyScripts, Powershell commands, Base64 encoding/decoding, PythonScripts and Discord servers
  ## The script is a keylogger that logs the user's keystrokes into a key_logs.txt and sends the content of that file every minute to your discord server
  ## Currently this keylogger only works for Windows devices

  
# To Do
  ## 1. Create a private discord server
  ## 1.1 Create a text channel and add a webhook to that channel
  ## 2. Create a GitHub Repository like mine
  ## 3. Modify keylogger.py so that it uses YOUR webhook
  ## 3.1 Compile it and encode the keylogger.exe through an online base64 encoder
  ## 4. Upload the encoded file to your GitHub Repository and navigate to it and click on "RAW"
  ## 4.1 Copy the URL and modify the keylog_encoded.txt replace the current URL and all .txt files with your URL and .txt file
  ## 5. Open qFlipper, navigate to the SD card and the BadUSB folder and upload the keylog_encoded.txt to it

# Happy hacking :)
